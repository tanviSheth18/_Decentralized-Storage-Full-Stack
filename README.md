# Decentralized Storage Full Stack

Check out my full stack clone for OneDrive, providing the same functionalities as a centralized storage service, but with 10x security, assurance, and convenience. This application leverages IFPS storage and its node hosting system to allow users to upload, delete, rename, list, search and organize files into folders, in a completely decentralized manner. Users can also share their data, peer-to-peer with no intermediary, and rely on a service without vulerabilities to cyber attacks, data breaches, single points of failure or central access. 

Find my front-end React interface and back-end Solidity/Javascript that enables a complete ecosystem to store data on a resilient and long-term decentralized network.

Note: In my project, I create an application that leverages the IPFS storage so users can interact with their files in a manner that is identical to OneDrive. This is an ongoing project, and I still have lots to work on to be at par with centralized storage services, but I wanted to share my V1 of the smart contract + specific functionalities, each of which represent a step closer to an identical experience.
